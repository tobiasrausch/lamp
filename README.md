Scripts to carry out the data analysis for the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) testing (Covid screening). Samples are always in pairs on the plate. Odd columns are the IC measurement and the next even column the corresponding COVID measurement. An example plate layout is in the data directory.
